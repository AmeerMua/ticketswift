/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model with two primary roles: Users and Admins.
 * - Core Philosophy: The default posture is to deny all access. Rules then grant specific
 *   permissions. Admins, identified by a document in the `/admins` collection, have
 *   broad access for management. Regular users have restricted access, primarily to their
 *   own data and public information.
 * - Data Structure: Data is organized into a top-level public `/events` collection and a
 *   user-private `/users` collection. Each user's data, including their bookings, is
 *   nested under their unique user ID (`/users/{userId}`), creating a clear ownership hierarchy.
 * - Key Security Decisions:
 *   - Admin access is managed via an `/admins` collection (Database-Based Access Control).
 *   - User enumeration is prevented by disallowing `list` operations on the top-level `/users` collection.
 *   - Public data like events and ticket categories is readable by anyone, but writable only by admins.
 *   - A critical business rule is enforced: only users with `verified == true` on their user
 *     document can create new bookings, and each booking is limited to 3 tickets.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: The `userId` is denormalized onto `Booking` documents.
 *   This allows security rules on the `/users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId}` path to authorize
 *   requests by checking the document's `userId` field against the user's auth token, without
 *   needing extra database reads.
 * - Structural Segregation: Public data (`/events`) is stored separately from user-specific
 *   private data (`/users`), and administrative roles are in their own
 *   dedicated collection. This separation simplifies rules and improves query performance.
